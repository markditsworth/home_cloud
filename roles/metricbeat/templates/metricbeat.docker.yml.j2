# ================================= Processors =================================

# Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to
# enhance the event with external metadata. This section defines a list of
# processors that are applied one by one and the first one receives the initial
# event:
#
#   event -> filter1 -> event1 -> filter2 ->event2 ...
#
# The supported processors are drop_fields, drop_event, include_fields,
# decode_json_fields, and add_cloud_metadata.
#
# For example, you can use the following processors to keep the fields that
# contain CPU load percentages, but remove the fields that contain CPU ticks
# values:
#
#processors:
#  - include_fields:
#      fields: ["cpu"]
#  - drop_fields:
#      fields: ["cpu.user", "cpu.system"]
#
# The following example drops the events that have the HTTP response code 200:
#
#processors:
#  - drop_event:
#      when:
#        equals:
#          http.code: 200
#
# The following example renames the field a to b:
#
#processors:
#  - rename:
#      fields:
#        - from: "a"
#          to: "b"

# provider about the host machine. It works on EC2, GCE, DigitalOcean,
# Tencent Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud.
#
#processors:
#  - add_cloud_metadata: ~
#
# The following example enriches each event with the machine's local time zone
# offset from UTC.
#
#processors:
#  - add_locale:
#      format: offset
#
# The following example enriches each event with docker metadata, it matches

# The following example enriches each event with docker metadata, it matches
# container id from log path available in `source` field (by default it expects
# it to be /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log).
#
#processors:
#  - add_docker_metadata: ~
#
# The following example enriches each event with host metadata.
#
#processors:

# The following example enriches each event with process metadata using
# process IDs included in the event.
#
#processors:
#  - add_process_metadata:

#        - message
#      max_bytes: 1024
#      fail_on_error: false

# distribution (for example, the sample dashboards).
# If not set by a CLI flag or in the configuration file, the default for the
# home path is the location of the binary.
#path.home:

# The configuration path for the Metricbeat installation. This is the default
# base path for configuration files, including the main YAML configuration file
# and the Elasticsearch template file. If not set by a CLI flag or in the
# configuration file, the default for the configuration path is the home path.
#path.config: ${path.home}

# The data path for the Metricbeat installation. This is the default base path

# ====================== Index Lifecycle Management (ILM) ======================

# Configure index lifecycle management (ILM). These settings create a write
# alias and add additional settings to the index template. When ILM is enabled,
# output.elasticsearch.index is ignored, and the write alias is used to set the
# index name.

# Enable ILM support. Valid values are true, false, and auto. When set to auto
# (the default), the Beat uses index lifecycle management when it connects to a
# cluster that supports ILM; otherwise, it creates daily indices.
setup.ilm.enabled: true

# Set the prefix used in the index lifecycle write alias name. The default alias
# name is 'metricbeat-%{[agent.version]}'.

# Overwrite the lifecycle policy at startup. The default is false.
#setup.ilm.overwrite: false



# ================================== Logging ===================================

# There are four options for the log output: file, stderr, syslog, eventlog
# The file output is the default.

# Sets log level. The default log level is info.
# Available log levels are: error, warning, info, debug
#logging.level: info

# Enable debug output for selected components. To enable all selectors use ["*"]
# Other available selectors are "beat", "publisher", "service"
# Multiple selectors can be chained.

# Send all logging output to stderr. The default is false.
#logging.to_stderr: false

# Send all logging output to syslog. The default is false.
#logging.to_syslog: false

# Send all logging output to Windows Event Logs. The default is false.
#logging.to_eventlog: false

# If enabled, Metricbeat periodically logs its internal metrics that have changed
# in the last period. For each metric that changed, the delta from the value at
# the beginning of the period is logged. Also, the total values for
# all non-zero internal metrics are logged on shutdown. The default is true.
#logging.metrics.enabled: true

# The period after which to log the internal metrics. The default is 30s.
#logging.metrics.period: 30s

# A list of metrics namespaces to report in the logs. Defaults to [stats].

  # Enable log file rotation on time intervals in addition to size-based rotation.
  # Intervals must be at least 1s. Values of 1m, 1h, 24h, 7*24h, 30*24h, and 365*24h
  # are boundary-aligned with minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years as
  # reported by the local system clock. All other intervals are calculated from the
  # Unix epoch. Defaults to disabled.
  #interval: 0

  # Rotate existing logs on startup rather than appending to the existing
  # file. Defaults to true.
  # rotateonstartup: true

  # Rotated files are either suffixed with a number e.g. metricbeat.1 when
  # renamed during rotation. Or when set to date, the date is added to
  # the end of the file. On rotation a new file is created, older files are untouched.
